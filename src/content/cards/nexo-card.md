## Nexo Card Review

The Nexo Card offers a unique dual-mode functionality, allowing users to switch between a credit and debit card with a single tap in the Nexo app. This provides flexibility in how you manage and spend your digital assets.

In **Debit Mode**, you can spend your crypto and stablecoin balances directly, with transactions being seamless and instant.

In **Credit Mode**, you can borrow against your crypto collateral, allowing you to spend without selling your assets. This mode also offers cashback rewards, paid out in either Nexo's native NEXO token or in Bitcoin. The amount of cashback and other perks, like free ATM withdrawals, are determined by your Loyalty Tier, which is based on the percentage of NEXO Tokens in your portfolio.

The card is available as both a virtual and physical Mastercard, and is accepted globally. However, it's currently only available to residents of the European Economic Area (EEA) and the UK.
