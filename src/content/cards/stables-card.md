## Stables Card Review

The Stables Card is designed for users who want to spend their stablecoins as easily as cash. It functions as a Mastercard and is available in both virtual and physical forms.

### Key Features:

*   **Direct Stablecoin Spending:** Use stablecoins like USDT, USDC, and DAI for everyday purchases without needing to convert them to fiat first.
*   **Zero Spending Fees:** Stables charges no fees for local or international spending, and no foreign exchange (FX) fees.
*   **Rewards Program:** Earn "Stables Points" with every transaction.
*   **Flexible Top-ups:** Fund your account with stablecoins from over 20 different blockchain networks, or with local currencies via bank transfer or debit card.

### Fees:

While spending is free, there are fees associated with topping up your account with fiat and sending money to external wallets or bank accounts. These fees vary depending on the method and region. Stablecoin deposits are free.

The Stables Card aims to bridge the gap between DeFi and traditional finance, offering a secure and convenient way to use your digital assets globally.
