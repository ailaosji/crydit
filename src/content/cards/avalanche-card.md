## Avalanche Card Review

The Avalanche Card is a crypto-backed Visa card that allows you to spend your crypto assets, such as AVAX and USDC, at any merchant that accepts Visa. It is issued by Rain Liquidity and offers both virtual and physical cards.

### Key Features:

*   **Global Acceptance:** Use your card anywhere Visa is accepted, both online and in-store.
*   **No Hidden Fees:** The card has no monthly account fees, and both virtual and physical cards are issued for free.
*   **Security:** The app provides features like instant card freezing and PIN changes to give you full control over your card's security.
*   **Easy to Use:** The card can be added to Apple Pay and Google Wallet for convenient contactless payments.

### Fees and Availability:

The Avalanche Card is currently available in many U.S. states, Latin America, and the Caribbean. It has a 1% foreign exchange fee, but no other fees are explicitly mentioned on the website. Users should be aware that network gas fees may still apply when moving crypto.

To get the card, you need to download the Avalanche Card app and complete a KYC verification process, which includes providing personal information and a valid government-issued ID.
