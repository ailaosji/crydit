## Trustee Card

The Trustee crypto card is an integrated payment card that allows you to use digital currencies in everyday life. Users can independently issue a crypto card within the Trustee Plus app and add it to Apple Pay or Google Pay.

**Please note:** As of our latest review, the Trustee Card is temporarily unavailable. The company is currently directing users to their partner, Quicko Card. We will update this page when the Trustee Card becomes available again.
