## MetaMask Card Review

MetaMask, one of the most popular self-custody wallets, has introduced its own crypto debit card. The MetaMask Card, powered by Mastercard, allows you to spend your crypto directly from your wallet at millions of locations worldwide.

### How it Works

The card connects to your MetaMask wallet and allows you to spend a selection of stablecoins (USDC, USDT, etc.) and wETH on the Linea network. When you make a purchase, the card converts your crypto to fiat in real-time. This means you maintain full control over your assets until the moment of transaction.

### Tiers and Fees

The MetaMask Card comes in two tiers:

*   **Free Tier:** A virtual card with no annual fee. It has standard transaction and withdrawal fees.
*   **Metal Tier:** A premium physical card with a $199 annual fee. It offers benefits like no cross-border fees and free ATM withdrawals up to a certain limit.

The card is currently available in the US, UK, and several countries in Europe and Latin America. While it only supports the Linea network for now, MetaMask plans to add support for more networks in the future.
